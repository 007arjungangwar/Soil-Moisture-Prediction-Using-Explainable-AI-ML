# Soil-Moisture-Prediction-Using-Explainable-AI-ML
Developed a machine learning model for soil moisture prediction using Explainable AI methods. Implemented ML/DL models like RFR, GBR,  XGBoost, LSTM, CNN, hybrid CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU, GNN and transformer model with and without clustering to evaluate their predictive performance. Conducted clustering, identifying clusters in the time-series data.
